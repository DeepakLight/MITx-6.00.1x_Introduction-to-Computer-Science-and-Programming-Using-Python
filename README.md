# MITx: 6.00.1x
"**Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python**," is 3 credits course from MITx on the edX platform. In this course provide basic to hard excercise and problem sets. So, the user get gradually understanding in python.

# Projects:
1. [Hangman](https://repl.it/@codenigma1/UltimateDescriptiveFlashdrive-1): If you have dare, beat the computer.
2. [WordGame](https://repl.it/@codenigma1/OnerlookedDifferentVariable): Create the word with possible letter. It build both version, first play the game by yourself, then repeat the same game with computer and see who make highest score.
3. [Encryption and Decryption messages](https://repl.it/@codenigma1/CheapAdventurousLogic): This basic encryption and decryption message. it remind me Alan Turing enigma machine.
